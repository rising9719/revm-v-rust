### 17.10.2021:
-For past few weeks working on this structure and project in general become really good and I like it. For me it surved as good distraction for past few weeks and i think i am going to get drained if i continue working on it, so i am taking break and i intend to come back after few months and finish it.
- For status:
    * machine/spec/opcodes/precompiles(without modexp) feels good and I probably dont need to touch them.
    * inspector: is what i wanted, full control on insides of EVM so that we can control it and modify it. will probably needs to add some small tweaks to interface but nothing major.
    * subroutines: Feels okay but it needs more scrutiny just to be sure that all corner cases are covered.
    * Test that are failing (~20) are mostly related to EIP-158: State clearing. For EIP-158 I will time to do it properly.
    * There is probably benefit of replaing HashMap hasher with something simpler, but this is research for another time.
